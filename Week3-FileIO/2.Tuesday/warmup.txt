Use the Code Blocks Activity.java file for the warmup this morning.
It's NOT an IntelliJ project, but you can still open the file itself in IntelliJ
by double clicking on it

Given the sample code please perform the following tasks:

1. Identify all of the code blocks. State which line they begin on, and which they end on.

I'll do the first one for free:

The class CodeBlocksActivity begins on line 1 and ends on line 33. 

2. Why won't lines 22 and 23 compile? (You may remove these lines if you wish to run the program).

3. Without running the program, what do you expect the console output to be? Be exact.
